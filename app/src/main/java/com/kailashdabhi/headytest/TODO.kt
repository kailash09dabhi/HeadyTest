//
//E-Commerce
//
//The​ ​Assessment
//This assessment is for us to test your basic skill set, this includes your technical coding skills
//as ​well ​as ​your ​logical ​& ​organisational ​skills.
//For following JSON (URL: https://stark-spire-93433.herokuapp.com/json), your task is to create
//a ​mobile ​Android ​interface ​that ​would ​consume ​and ​output ​the ​data.
//Assuming the data is being delivered asynchronously from the URL shared above, persist the
//data ​into ​a ​local ​datastore.
//Based on the data, design a navigation for the app. The data contains basic e-commerce
//logic, there are categories/sub-categories for different products. Products have properties
//like ​size, ​colour ​and rankings​.
//In the “ranking” section, products are grouped into ranking. Design an approach to sort or
//group ​the ​products ​based ​on ​the ​ranking ​it ​falls ​under.
//You will have to display this data in best possible way you can imagine. User should be able
//to ​browse ​data ​category/sub-category ​wise.
//There ​is ​a ​time ​limit ​of ​5 ​days ​to ​complete ​this ​task.
//You should start this project under your GitHub profile and after the completion of it you
//should ​mail ​us ​the ​link ​for ​the ​same.
//The​ ​Rules
//1.) ​You ​may ​use ​whatever ​development ​environment/tools ​you ​choose.
//2.) You may use any libraries of your choice, however the bulk of the solution should be your
//own ​code.
//3.) You will be required to use Git as you write the app. Please commit your code as often as
//possible.
//4.) Don’t worry too much about the styling of the output, this assessment is testing coding &
//layout ​skills, ​not ​your ​photoshop ​skills!
//Take ​on ​this ​assessment ​/ ​task ​honestly!!
